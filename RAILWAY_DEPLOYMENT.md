## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs
```bash
railway logs
```

### Monitor Performance
- Railway provides built-in monitoring
- Check "Metrics" tab in dashboard
- Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage

### Health Checks
- Backend: `https://your-domain.com/api/healthz`
- SFU: `https://your-domain.com/sfu/health`

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Change default passwords
- [ ] Use strong JWT secret
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic with Railway)
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets

### SSL/HTTPS
Railway automatically provides SSL certificates for all deployments.

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check build logs
   railway logs --service=frontend
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify database is running
   railway logs --service=db
   ```

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Ensure SFU service is healthy
   - Check WebSocket URL configuration
   - Verify firewall settings

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check service status
railway status

# View specific service logs
railway logs --service=backend

# Restart services
railway service restart backend

# SSH into container (if needed)
railway shell
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling

### Auto-scaling
Railway automatically scales based on traffic. You can configure:
- Minimum instances
- Maximum instances
- CPU/memory limits

### Manual Scaling
```bash
# Scale specific service
railway scale backend=2
```

## ðŸ’° Cost Optimization

### Railway Pricing
- Pay per usage
- Free tier available
- Automatic scaling

### Cost Saving Tips
1. Use development environment for testing
2. Monitor resource usage
3. Set appropriate scaling limits
4. Use Railway's free tier for small projects

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Integration
